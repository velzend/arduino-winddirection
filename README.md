# Engineering some old electronics back to life with Arduino && La Crosse TX23

Project using an Arduino and a La Crosse TX23 wind-speed and direction sensor to bring a old wind direction display back to life!

The display has old incandescence light bulb fittings, in which I mounted 6V bicycle lightbulbs.
The lightbulbs are powered via logical FETS using PWM to allow a nice fade-in and fade-out effect. 
Everything is powered using a 5V DC USB adapter.

The first design using a 12V power supply, which didnt work stable so I switched to 5V DC and powered the Arduino via USB.
